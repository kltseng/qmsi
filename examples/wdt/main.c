 * The watchdog timer can operate in two modes.
 * 1. If the timer expires reset the SoC immediately.
 * 2. If the timer expires, generate an interrupt, if the timer is not reloaded
 *    before the timer expires for a second time ,the WDT will reset the SoC.
 *
 * In this example, we operate in the second mode and reload the WDT every time
 * an interrupt is generated, this way the SoC does not reset.
 *
 * Note: on Quark SE, the WDT will automatically pause if the x86 core is in the
 * C2 state. As a result the WDT will not fire or generate interrupts. If
 * using the sensor subsystem, it is advised to use one of the supplied timers
 * to act as a watchdog.
